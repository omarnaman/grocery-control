# Grocery Control

**Grocery Control** is an eco-system for mainly handling shopping lists, but can be used as an application for anything based on checklists.

# Features
The goal of **Grocery Control** is to create a platform for easily sharable checklists(groups) to be watched simultaneously by multiple people and keeping them up-to-date with all the actions on the watched checklists.

**Grocery Control** happened to address the haphazard grocery list management. No need for calls, messages  mid shopping to add new items to the list, or old-fashioned pen & paper lists, just modify the shared list over the cloud.
